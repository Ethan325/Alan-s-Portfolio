                    <p>My main strength in skill is the ability to create websites from scratch or from template. I have some skill and knowledge in business , although i have ran a clothing line with 3 other friends and we did fail, i learned how the buisness industry works. I am currently starting a bakery business, leaning more towards cookies and french macarons as the specialty.I am also currently learning and putting together a game and software development team.</p>

                    <p>I Love to program, although its a tough mind game at times, I enjoy every bug, algorithim, and method of it. This includes game development, whih im still learning, web design and software development, and even music. I love music aswell, i enjoy creating sounds and editing them, thus the reason i have so many gadgets for production at home. Another hobby i put alot of time and effort in is the gym, i swear my family hates me for this, but i basically almost live at the gym, i go 6 days a week for1- 2 hours of training, i take care of what i consume aswell as take care of my body in terms of health.</p>

I also one day want to be a Musician artist, friends and family have told me i have really good taste in music and ive been performing aswell as singing since i was 8, i wanna make the dream of becoming a celebrity a reality.</p>
